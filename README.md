### mini-Icons ###
This is a collection of mini icons for use on your websites with commercial use. The icons are designed in CorelDraw and converted to SVG format.
All icons are made in vector technique

When designing icons, I was inspired by general industrial design, generally available signs, tools, and furniture.

If you have any question, suggestion or issue then please feel free to fire me **[open an issue](https://github.com/tc-soft/mini-Icons/issues/new)**.
